        <p>They were going full steam ahead in their world tour schedule, fresh off the North American leg of 
            Ode to You and slated to perform in several more cities across Asia and Europe. But after their 
            concert in Pasay, the Philippines, K-pop powerhouse SEVENTEEN canceled the remaining shows in 
            February and March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the change in plans, the 13-member 
            group from South Korea still found ways to bring fans together. “Left & Right,” SEVENTEEN’s new 
            title track from the latest album Heng:garae, created the perfect opportunity for a quarantine 
            TikTok dance challenge. With an easy-to-learn chorus routine—choreographed by main dancer Hoshi 
            and members of Team Same, a choreography team SEVENTEEN works with regularly—and a catchy refrain 
            resonant of the Cupid Shuffle, “Left & Right” drew fans from around the world, and a large number 
            of K-pop artists, to groove along.</p>
